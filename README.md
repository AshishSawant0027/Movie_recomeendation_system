# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
- This project implements a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. 
- The system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and cosine similarity to recommend movies based on user preferences. 
- The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, and the project is developed in Python using Jupyter and PyCharm.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyCharm
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
- The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) and consists of various movie attributes that are used to generate recommendations. 
- Due to file size limitations, some large files are not included in this repository.

## Features
- Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values and incorrect data formats.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic EDA to understand data distribution and relationships.
- Recommendation System: Implemented using cosine similarity with the help of NLTK.

## Deployment
- The project is converted into a pickle file for easy deployment. 
- The environment was created using PyCharm to ensure all dependencies are managed effectively.
